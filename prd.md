# Product Requirements Document: E-Commerce Backend System

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document outlines the requirements for a modular e-commerce backend system that provides authentication, product management, order processing, and payment integration.

### 1.2 Scope

The system encompasses user management, product catalog, shopping features, payment processing, and monitoring capabilities.

### 1.3 Definitions and Acronyms

- **JWT**: JSON Web Token
- **ULID**: Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier
- **CRUD**: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- **OAuth**: Open Authorization
- **ELK**: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 System Architecture

- Modular monolith (initial phase)
- Migration path to microservices using Kafka
- Redis caching layer
- PostgreSQL database
- ELK stack for logging and monitoring

### 2.2 User Roles

- Admin: Product and user management
- Customer: Shopping and account management
- Guest: Browse and search products

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Authentication & Authorization
